## how to add content?

There is 3 ways you can add content

### Make a text file

* Save the html door in [aboutme/makemyown/example1](https://github.com/GregDav/om/tree/master/aboutme/makemyown/Example1)
* In the same folder, place a text file named "destinations.txt" containing all the URL links to the sources you wish to consult.
* This door will parse the text and find all the "http" and display them.

### List sources

* Save the html door in [aboutme/makemyown/example2](https://github.com/GregDav/om/tree/master/aboutme/makemyown/Example2)
* Open the html file with text editor or notepad and edit the list of URL links to those you wish to consult.

### Drop files/Create Shortcuts

* Save the html door in [aboutme/makemyown/example3](https://github.com/GregDav/om/tree/master/aboutme/makemyown/Example3)
* Simply drop any file or shortcut you wish to consult in the same folder as the knob.

## how to customize door?

All doors can be customized once downloaded.
